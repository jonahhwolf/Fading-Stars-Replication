## Introduction

This paper is a replication of Gutiérrez and Philippon (2019), itself a response to Autor et al. (2020). Gutiérrez and Philippon provide evidence contra Autor et al. that growth of the U.S. aggregate profit share should not be explained by firm-level innovations, but rather by market concentration. To do this, they disaggregate firm-year observations in the Compustat database by 4-digits NAICS code and identify the share of sales accruing to the top four firms by market value in each industry.

## Data

For their exercise, Gutiérrez and Philippon produce a consolidated dataset, merging Compustat data with data from other public sources.

First they download a directory of public companies with their identifiers ("gvkey") and SIC and NAICS industry codings from the "comp_na_daily_all.company" table.

They also download data on market fundamentals from the "Merged Fundamental Annual File" ("funda"). They filter this data to include data from consolidated balance sheets, from industrial (non-financial) companies, from standardized balance sheets, from domestic firms, and with data in US dollars.

The authors download data on prices and shares outstanding from CRSP's "crspmsf" table and linking identifiers from the CRSP/Compustat Merged ("CCM") linktable (now deprecated?) <https://www.kaichen.work/?p=138>
